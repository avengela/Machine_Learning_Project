# Machine_Learning_Project
Final project Machine Learning - CDV 2022


# Task - description
The data consists of 2 splits train_data.csv and test_data.csv. There are numeric observations labelled either -1 or +1. Labels for the training data are located in in train_labels.csv. 
The aim of the project is to predict labels for the testing data.

Desired output:
Save predictions in test_labels.csv,
Prepare a report (saved as report.md)with the explanations on how you came up with the solution. What obstacles you faced and how did you solve them. Add also information about data quality and so on.
